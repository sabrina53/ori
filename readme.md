# Ori - Freelancing app

### About the Project: 
Ori was inspired due to my own personal struggles when I first started out as a freelancer after university. 
Thinking back, I would have liked to have had an easy and understandable resource to go to for such formalities that were hard 
to understand then. Such as, knowing what to charge clients, as well as, and writing up proposals, contracts, invoices.
Thus, its ment to help them learn the ropes to freelancing as they begin their career. I designed Ori to be simple, user friendly and visually appealing.
