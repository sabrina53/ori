	<h2 class="">Download our contract template and take these tips into account when writing your own</h2>

<div id="contractgrid">
  <h2 class="par1">
		<p class="boldtxt">Put the agreement under your company’s name – not your own</p>
		<p>If something goes wrong, you’ll carry all the liability, which could be bad news. Instead, convert your work into a separate entity and only enter contracts under that name.</p>
			<br>
		<p class="boldtxt">Clearly outline the scope of work</p>
		<p>Some freelancers opt to use their proposal – which outlines the scope of the project as well as the timeline and have the client sign-off. Others choose to put the scope of work in the body of the contract itself. This will help prevent any confusion regarding your responsibilities.</p>
			<br>
		<p class="boldtxt">Get their address (not P.O. box)</p>
		<p>In the event that you want to take legal action against your client your going to need to know where they’re located.</p>
			<br>
		<p class="boldtxt">Some questions to consider:</p>
		<p>* Will there be a “kill fee” or some other compensation for you if the client cancels the project after you’ve started?</p>
  </h2>

   <h2 class="par2">
		<p>* Will there be a late fee if your client doesn’t pay on time?
		   * Will you be reimbursed for expenses?
		   * How will changes to the scope of work, as outlined in the contract, affect your fees?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="boldtxt">Get the copyrights in writing</p>
        <p>Generally, you have two choices when it comes to ownership of anything you have created: You either give your client ownership over the work or you give them a license to use it and retain ownership. If you choose to use a license, clearly outline its permissions.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="boldtxt">Limit your liability</p>
        <p>If a promise or statement you make in a contract turns out not to be true, you’ll pay the harm your client suffered as a result. These are called indemnification promises. Your contract should cap your liability at a reasonable amount, typically the amount you make under the contract.</p>

  </h2>

  <h2 class="par3">
		<p class="boldtxt">Be clear that the written agreement is the whole agreement</p>
  		<p>It’s important to include language that states that the contract represents the whole agreement. This will help both you and your client understand what work you’re agreeing to perform – and what you’re not.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p class="boldtxt">Specify the process for changing the agreement</p>
		<p>Things change – especially for freelancers. Flexibility may be one of your selling points, but take a moment to amend any changes to the project in writing and get your client to sign off. Better yet? Include a clause in your original contract that stipulates all changes must be confirmed in writing. That way your client can know what to expect when he changes his mind… again.</p>
